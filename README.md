# Laser Tag

A quick example of how you can use the [adafruit Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333) to make a game of Laser Tag.  This uses the neopixels for health display and the IR receiver to take hits from the enemy.

You can fake the IR with a press of button A, and can reset with button B.  Should work with a any remote or device that blasts IR.

NOTE: Current example relies on an Infrared Error being thrown.  Welcome to Hacktown.
